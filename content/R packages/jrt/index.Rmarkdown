# What it's about

The goal of jrt is to provide tools to use Item-Response Theory (IRT) models on judgment data, especially in the context of the Consensual Assessment Technique, as presented in Myszkowski (2021).

## Vignette

The vignette can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jrt/vignettes/my-vignette.html



## Installation

You can install the released version of jrt from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("jrt")
```

## Example use

- Load the library

```{r}
library(jrt)
```

- Load example dataset

```{r}
data <- jrt::ratings
```

- To automatically select models 

```{r eval=F}
fit <- jrt(data)
```

- To select models a priori

```{r eval=F}
fit <- jrt(data, irt.model = "PCM")
```

```{r echo=F}
fit <- jrt(data, irt.model = "PCM", silent = T)
```

- To plot all category curves

```{r}
jcc.plot(fit)
```

- To plot one judge's category curves

```{r}
jcc.plot(fit, judge = 1)
```

- Graphical options

```{r}
jcc.plot(fit, 
         judge = 1,
         overlay.reliability = T, 
         greyscale = T, 
         theme = "classic",
         font.family = "serif")
```

- To plot total information

```{r}
info.plot(fit)
```

- To plot judge information

```{r}
info.plot(fit, judge = 1)
```

- Other options for information plots

```{r}
info.plot(fit, type = "Reliability",
          y.line = .70,
          y.limits = c(0,1),
          theta.span = 4,
          theme = "classic")
```
