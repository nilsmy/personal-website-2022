description: I am a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Pace University, NYC, and freelance psychometrics and survey methods consultant. I received my PhD from Université René Descartes (France), and my main research interest is the application and improvement of psychometric methods to measure and understand creative, aesthetic and interpersonal skills, especially applied in occupational contexts. I have authored over 35 peer-reviewed publications and 3 packages for the statistical programming language `R`, and received the *2020 Berlyne Award for Outstanding Contributions by an Early Career Scholar* from the *American Psychological Association* (Division 10). I regularly collaborate with international researchers, especially from France (Université de Paris, IESEG Business School) and Belgium (Solvay Business School), and have worked as a psychometrics and statistics consultant for multiple US and international companies and R&D teams.
