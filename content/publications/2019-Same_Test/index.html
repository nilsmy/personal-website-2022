excerpt: In this paper, we propose to generalize the use of Nested Logit Models and implement its use for online personnel selection procedures that use reasoning tests with multiple choices (e.g., matrix-type tests). We find that using such models results in gains of reliability, especially at low ability levels.

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Assessing job applicants’ general mental ability online poses psychometric challenges due to the necessity of having brief but accurate tests. Recent research (Myszkowski &amp; Storme, 2018)
suggests that recovering distractor information through Nested Logit Models (NLM; Suh &amp; Bolt, 2010) increases the reliability of ability estimates in reasoning matrix-type tests. In the present research,
we extended this result to a different context (online intelligence testing for recruitment) and in a larger sample (N = 2949 job applicants). We found that the NLMs outperformed the Nominal
Response Model (Bock, 1970) and provided significant reliability gains compared with their binary logistic counterparts. In line with previous research, the gain in reliability was especially obtained at
low ability levels. Implications and practical recommendations are discussed.</p>
