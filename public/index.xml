      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>What it&amp;rsquo;s about   The goal of jrt is to provide tools to use Item-Response Theory (IRT) models on judgment data, especially in the context of the Consensual Assessment Technique, as presented in Myszkowski (2021).

      <title>Accounting for Variable Task Discrimination in Divergent Thinking Fluency Measurement – An Example of the Benefits of a 2-Parameter Poisson Counts Model and its Bifactor Extension Over the Rasch Poisson Counts Model</title>
      <link>/publications/2021-2ppcm/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/publications/2021-2ppcm/</guid>
      <description>What it’s about In this paper, we introduce new psychometric models for count/fluency tasks (tasks in which individuals have to provide many instances). Notably, we extent the Rasch Poisson Counts Model (RPCM) to account for variable discrimination (2-Parameter Poisson Counts Model) and to account for local dependencies/nuisance factors (Bifactor 2-Parameter Poisson Counts Model).
 Abstract Fluency tasks are among the most common item formats for the assessment of certain cognitive abilities, such as verbal fluency or divergent thinking.</description>

      <title>AMCTestmakeR – Generate LaTeX Code for Auto-Multiple-Choice (AMC)</title>
      <link>/r-packages/amc/</link>

      <description>AMCTestmakeR provides functions to be used with the free Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) software Auto Multiple Choice (https://www.auto-multiple-choice.net/).
It&amp;rsquo;s main purpose is to facilitate working with R and AMC in parallel, but it can also be used to transform a spreadsheet into an AMC questionnaire easily.
So far, the features are limited to generating AMC-LaTeX code questions for Multiple Choice Questionnaires (single and multiple answer). Hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s how most people use Auto Multiple Choice.</description>

 site header (set in config.toml), site footer (set in config.toml),  homepage (set in content/_index.md),  about page in the sidebar (set in content/about/sidebar/index.md), and  contact page (set in content/form/contact.md).  Read on to learn how to set up your social icons, and how to show/hide them.

Rmarkdown     In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either
$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\). There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because knitr automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.
And you can use
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ to get a math paragraph:</description>

      <title>A Mokken Scale Analysis of the Last Series of the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM-LS)</title>
      <link>/publications/2020-mokken/</link>

      <guid>/publications/2020-mokken/</guid>
      <description>What it’s about In this paper, I reanalyze a dataset for a special issue of Journal of Intelligence. The analysis uses the framework of Mokken Scale Analysis (MSA), which is a non-parametric approach to relations between item responses and attributes (i.e. Item-Response Theory).
 Abstract Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (Raven 1941) is a widely used 60-item long measure of general mental ability. It was recently suggested that, for situations where taking this test is too time consuming, a shorter version, comprised of only the last series of the Standard Progressive Matrices (Myszkowski and Storme 2018) could be used, while preserving satisfactory psychometric properties (Garcia-Garzon et al.</description>

      <guid>/publications/2021-creativity-unethicality/</guid>
      <description>What it’s about In this paper, we provide a meta-analysis of correlations between (un)ethical behavior and creativity, notably controlling for how the constructs were measured – which, as it turns out, is important when considering the heterogeneity of the findings.
 Abstract A growing line of research suggests that creativity and unethicality are intrinsically related to one another. However, the idea has been challenged both by theoretical arguments and by heterogeneous empirical findings.</description>

      <description>nhstplot is a fairly simple package to use. This vignette is intended to explain the basics (plotting using the defaults), before showing how to use the options.
The basics   After installing the library with install.packages(&amp;quot;nhstplot&amp;quot;) you need to load the library:
library(nhstplot) &amp;lsquo;nhstplot&amp;rsquo; is composed of 4 functions, one for each major NHST test &amp;ldquo;family&amp;rdquo; :
 \(\chi^2\) tests (with the plotchisqtest function) \(F\) tests (with the plotftest function) \(t\) tests (with the plotttest function) \(z\) tests (with the plotztest function)  Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to use each one without changing the graphical options.</description>

      <title>Same Test, Better Scores – Boosting the Reliability of Short Online Intelligence Recruitment Tests with Nested Logit Item Response Theory Models</title>
      <link>/publications/2019-same_test/</link>

      <guid>/publications/2019-same_test/</guid>
      <description>What it’s about In this paper, we propose to generalize the use of Nested Logit Models and implement its use for online personnel selection procedures that use reasoning tests with multiple choices (e.g., matrix-type tests). We find that using such models results in gains of reliability, especially at low ability levels.
 Abstract Assessing job applicants’ general mental ability online poses psychometric challenges due to the necessity of having brief but accurate tests.</description>

      <description>What it’s about In this paper, we propose the use of the last series of the last series of the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM-LS) as a viable snapshot measure of g. We provide an extensive Item-Response Theory (IRT) analysis of the instrument, based on the binary (pass/fail) and nominal (response categories) data.
 Abstract Raven’s progressive matrices (Raven, 1941) are extremely popular measures of general mental ability. However, their length may not suit every researcher’s or practitioner’s needs.</description>
