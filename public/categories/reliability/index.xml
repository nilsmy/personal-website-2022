      <description>What it’s about In this paper, we propose to generalize the use of Nested Logit Models and implement its use for online personnel selection procedures that use reasoning tests with multiple choices (e.g., matrix-type tests). We find that using such models results in gains of reliability, especially at low ability levels.
