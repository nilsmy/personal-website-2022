      <description>What it&amp;rsquo;s about   In this paper, we study the relation between within-person variability in personality (the extent to which one changes in personality across situations) and career adaptability.
Abstract   Several studies have focused on stable personality traits as antecedents of career adaptability, but few have investigated more dynamic aspects of personality in relation to career adaptability. Recent theories on personality such as Whole Trait Theory (Fleeson, 2015) recognize that traits are often aroused in one situation but not in another (Allport, 1937), and that individuals are more or less flexible in responding to different situations.</description>
