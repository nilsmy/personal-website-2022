      <description>What it&amp;rsquo;s about   In this paper, we study how within-person variability (the tendency of a person to vary in personality) predicts success in negotiations.
Abstract   Prior research on the value of personality traits for predicting negotiation outcomes is rather inconclusive. Building on prior research and in light of recent personal- ity and negotiation theories, we discuss why the traditional approach to personal- ity traits has had limited success and propose an alternative approach to predicting negotiation outcomes from personality assessments.</description>
