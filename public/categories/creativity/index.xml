      <title>Creativity and unethicality – A systematic review and meta-analysis</title>

      <description>What it’s about In this paper, we provide a meta-analysis of correlations between (un)ethical behavior and creativity, notably controlling for how the constructs were measured – which, as it turns out, is important when considering the heterogeneity of the findings.
 Abstract A growing line of research suggests that creativity and unethicality are intrinsically related to one another. However, the idea has been challenged both by theoretical arguments and by heterogeneous empirical findings.</description>
