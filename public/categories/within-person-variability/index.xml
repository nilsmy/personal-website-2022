      <description>What it&amp;rsquo;s about   In this paper, we study how within-person variability (the tendency of a person to vary in personality) predicts success in negotiations.
Abstract   Prior research on the value of personality traits for predicting negotiation outcomes is rather inconclusive. Building on prior research and in light of recent personal- ity and negotiation theories, we discuss why the traditional approach to personal- ity traits has had limited success and propose an alternative approach to predicting negotiation outcomes from personality assessments.</description>

      <description>What it&amp;rsquo;s about   In this paper, we study the relation between within-person variability in personality (the extent to which one changes in personality across situations) and career adaptability.
Abstract   Several studies have focused on stable personality traits as antecedents of career adaptability, but few have investigated more dynamic aspects of personality in relation to career adaptability. Recent theories on personality such as Whole Trait Theory (Fleeson, 2015) recognize that traits are often aroused in one situation but not in another (Allport, 1937), and that individuals are more or less flexible in responding to different situations.</description>
